About:
This python script is to convert a FIRMS csv export and add weather data to each point using the meteostat python library. 
Meteostat imports weather data including average temperature (C), min and max temperature(C), precitpation, wind speed and direction and more by date and coordinates

The Meteostat python library must be installed for this script to run. You can install using pip:
    
pip install meteostat

More info on the meteostat library can be found in the documentation here:
https://dev.meteostat.net/python/ 

It seems likle there are definetly missing data and certain locations, but a lot of values did populate.

You will likely want to change the name of the imported csv to whatever export you retirieved from the FIRMS website. For now, I uploaded a 2021 VIIRS export

CAUTION:, you may want to replace the 'dfSat' with 'dfSatTest' in the last 'for' loop if you only want to test it out on the top 100 rows
